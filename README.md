rackspace-time
===========

The Rackspace-time cookbook contains recipes for installing the latest tzdata
(a.k.a. IANA or Olson) timezone database and setting the timezone on your
system.  It is a fork of the [timezone-ii cookbook by Larry
Gilbert.](https://github.com/L2G/timezone-ii)

Requirements
------------

This cookbook works with:

* CentOS and RHEL
* Debian
* Ubuntu

    <td>the path to the root of the tzdata files; the default value is for
    most known distributions of Linux</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>['localtime_path']</tt></td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>the path to the file used by the kernel to read the local timezone's
    settings; the default works for Linux and other *ix variants</td>
    <td>/etc/localtime</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>['use_symlink']</tt></td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>whether to use a symlink into the tzdata tree rather than make a copy
    of the appropriate timezone data file (linux-generic recipe only)</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Usage
-----

Set the "tz" attribute to your desired timezone and include the "rackspace-timezone"
recipe in your node's run list:

    {
      "name": "my_node",
      "tz": "Africa/Timbuktu",
      "run_list": [
        "recipe[rackspace_timezone]"
      ]
    }

### rackspace_timezone::default

The default recipe will first install or upgrade the IANA/Olson
timezone database package for your OS. Then it will configure the needed 
setting based on your OS.
